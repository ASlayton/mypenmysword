            <p>How can you miss me? I'm easy to find. I'm the guy with two hearts, remember? The Time Lords are an immensely civilised race. We can control our own environment - we can live forever, barring accidents, and we have the secret of space/time travel. I know who I am, I… AM… THE DOCTOR! A tear, Sarah Jane? No, don't cry. While there's life, there's... It's all right for you, Peri. You've only got one life. You'll age here in the TARDIS and then die. But me, I shall go on regenerating until all my lives are spent.

            Look at me. No plans, no backup, no weapons worth a damn. Oh, and something else I don't have: anything to lose. So, if you're sitting up there with your silly little spaceships and your silly little guns and you've any plans on taking the Pandorica tonight; just remember who's standing in your way. Remember every black day I ever stopped you and then, and then, do the smart thing. Let somebody else try first. Big scarf, bow tie, big embarrassing. Right! So stop dilly-dallying, and cross it! A little gratitude wouldn't irretrievably damage my ego.
              
            But it was a childish dream that made you a doctor. You dreamed you could hold back death. Isn't that true? If you could touch the alien sand and hear the cries of strange birds, and watch them wheel in another sky, would that satisfy you? The Time Lords are an immensely civilised race. We can control our own environment - we can live forever, barring accidents, and we have the secret of space/time travel. I reversed the polarity of the neutron flow. The best thing about a machine that makes sense is you can very easily make it turn out nonsense.</p>

            <p>I reversed the polarity of the neutron flow. Eh? Doctor who? What's he talking about…? It's a fez. I wear a fez now. Fezzes are cool. When I say run, run. ...RUN! My dear Miss Shaw, I never report myself anywhere, particularly not forthwith. Grace, I came back to life before your eyes. I held back death. Look, I can't make your dream come true forever, but I can make it come true today. Let's go in! Old ladies die all the time. It's practically in the job description. My last incarnation…oh, I was never happy with that one. It had a sort of feckless 'charm' which simply wasn't me.</p>
